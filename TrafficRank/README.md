# TrafficRank

[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is a link analysis algorithm originally used by Google to create rankings for webpages in their search engine. The algorithm relies on both the number and importance of incoming links to determine the relevance/popularity of webpages, hence generating a page-ranking. PageRank has been adapted to a [variety of non-internet application areas](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2014/11/03/more-than-just-a-web-search-algorithm-googles-pagerank-in-non-internet-contexts/), including [GeneRank](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2022/11/02/generank-a-breakthrough-adaptation-of-the-google-pagerank-algorithm/), [ProteinRank](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-general-procedure-of-ProteinRank-A-weighted-network-was-generated-by-a-random-walk_fig4_277781955), [ItemRank](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1625275.1625720), [MonitorRank](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2465529.2465753), [CiteRank](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15743-1_37) and [ServiceRank](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tq/2022/05/09440731/1tTpjOw0v6g).

This project tests an application: using traffic data (proxy for in-links) to infer the economic activity (proxy for relevance/)
